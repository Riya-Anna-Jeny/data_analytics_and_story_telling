# UNICEF Global Child Development Report
The first few years of a child’s life are a vital window for laying the foundations of health, learning, and emotional well-being. However, for millions of children around the world, this critical window is one of deprivation, malnutrition, and missed opportunities.
This report uses UNICEF’s global indicators to examine the realities of children across countries — highlighting gaps in stunting, deprivation, and life outcomes. With stark visuals and sharp analysis, we unveil the cycles of injustice that still limit the possibilities of far too many young people.
Every statistic is a tale. Every chart charts a future we can choose to change. It is our shared responsibility to ensure that every child not only survives but actually thrives.
This report contains 4 visulizations including: world map, bar chart, linear regression line on a scattered plot and time series graph on the selected countries.
